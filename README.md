## Features

*   Backup data from a source (e.g., database, local folder, API).
*   Store backups in a destination (e.g., cloud storage, another server).
*   Easy configuration using `config.json` for settings and `.env` for secrets.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [e.g., Python 3.8+, Node.js v16+, etc.]
*   [e.g., pip, npm, yarn, etc.]
*   Git

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Back-up-data-in-bulk.git
    cd Back-up-data-in-bulk
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Choose the command relevant to your project)*
    ```bash
    # For Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # For Node.js
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

This project uses two files for configuration, which are ignored by Git for security. You will need to create them manually.

1.  **Create a `.env` file for your secrets:**
    This file holds sensitive data like API keys and passwords.

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Add your credentials to the `.env` file. For example:
    ```env
    # Example for a database connection
    DB_USER="admin"
    DB_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"
    
    # Example for an S3 bucket
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_key"
    ```

2.  **Create a `config.json` file for settings:**
    This file holds non-sensitive configuration like source paths, destination details, etc.

    Create a `config.json` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration.

    **Example `config.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "filesystem",
        "path": "/path/to/your/data"
      },
      "destination": {
        "type": "s3",
        "bucketName": "my-backup-bucket",
        "region": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
    ```

## Usage

To run the backup process, execute the main script from the command line:

```bash
# Example for Python
python main.py

# Example for Node.js
node index.js
```
